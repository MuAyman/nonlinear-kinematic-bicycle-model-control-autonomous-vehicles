# Nonlinear Kinematic Bicycle Model Control

## Overview
This repository presents a **work-in-progress** implementation of a nonlinear kinematic bicycle model for ground vehicle motion and a comparative study of multiple trajectory tracking controllers. The project focuses on practical control design for vehicle dynamics, with emphasis on stability, tracking accuracy, and real-time feasibility.

## Project Status
🚧 **Under active development**  
Features, structure, and results are subject to change as the project evolves.

## Implemented Controllers
- PID Controller  
- Pure Pursuit  
- Stanley Controller  
- Model Predictive Control (MPC)  
- Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NLMPC)

## Key Features
- Nonlinear kinematic bicycle vehicle model  
- C++ implementation of all controllers  
- Trajectory tracking on predefined paths with varying curvature  
- Comparative evaluation of controller performance  
- Modular structure for future extensions and tuning  

## Tools & Technologies
- C++  
- Nonlinear vehicle modeling  
- Optimal and nonlinear control techniques  

## Applications
- Autonomous and electric vehicle control  
- Trajectory tracking and path-following problems  
- Control algorithm benchmarking  

## Notes
This repository is intended for educational and research purposes. It emphasizes control-oriented modeling and algorithm development rather than high-fidelity vehicle dynamics, and will be continuously refined.
